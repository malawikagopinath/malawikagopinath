The chart shows the comparison of the Nike vaporfly, a two fifty dollar shows, with other popular running brands. The graph measures different marathon end times across various shoes. In the interactive map found on the website one can hover over the individual circles to view different shoes and their different end times to see which shoes is claimed to be faster and by what percentage. Nike claims that the Vaporfly can imporve run time efficiency by four percent compared to all other shoes. The statistics found in this article are from Strava, a running and fitness app where one can record their runs, shoes, and effort.\nThe dot plot used to analyze this data is effective in showing the different shows analyzed and distinguishes the Nike Vaporfly as an ‘outlier’ while also providing a visual summary of different race times. However, there are also some limitations. For example, the dot plot only provides a linear view. We are able to see the percentage improvement but not how many participants used a particular shoe. Knowing how many participants used a particular brand and style of shoe would help to further analyze this data. There is also no clear control group and due to the nature of the study a control group is harder to achieve hence making this study more observational. There are also some external limitations to consider like whether the race routes were the same, weather conditions day of, athletic ability/competitiveness of each participant. It would also be interesting to see price of shoe versus durability and performance.\nThe chart used in this article distinguishes between the different shoes used and highlights performances and efficiency of race times based on the show worn. However, there are several limitations to this study such as a limited control group, number of participants, and other external factors. While providing visual representation, the missing factors would be able to make the graph more dimensional and provide missing context."
