The chart shows the comparison of the Nike vaporfly, a two fifty dollar shows, with other popular running brands. The graph measures different marathon end times across various shoes. In the interactive map found on the website one can hover over the individual circles to view different shoes and their different end times to see which shoes is claimed to be faster and by what percentage. Nike claims that the Vaporfly can imporve run time efficiency by four percent compared to all other shoes. The statistics found in this article are from Strava, a running and fitness app where one can record their runs, shoes, and effort.\nThe dot plot used to analyze this data is effective in showing the different shows analyzed and distinguishes the Nike Vaporfly as an ‘outlier’ while also providing a visual summary of different race times. However, there are also some limitations. For example, the dot plot only provides a linear view. We are able to see the percentage improvement but not how many participants used a particular shoe. Knowing how many participants used a particular brand and style of shoe would help to further analyze this data. There is also no clear control group and due to the nature of the study a control group is harder to achieve hence making this study more observational. There are also some external limitations to consider like whether the race routes were the same, weather conditions day of, athletic ability/competitiveness of each participant. It would also be interesting to see price of shoe versus durability and performance.\nThe chart used in this article distinguishes between the different shoes used and highlights performances and efficiency of race times based on the show worn. However, there are several limitations to this study such as a limited control group, number of participants, and other external factors. While providing visual representation, the missing factors would be able to make the graph more dimensional and provide missing context."

    "text": "1. Running Paul Murrell’s RGraphics basic R programs\n\ni. Can you change `pch`?\nYes, the pch value can be changed. Here are examples of different symbols used for the values on the scatter plot graph. For example, when the pch value on the graph was 16 the symbol was a filled in circle versus a triangle when it was 17. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nii. Try different cex values?\nThe cex values represents the sizes of the different plotting symbols and making them bigger or smaller. The larger the cex value the larger the plot. Here is an example between using cex value of 2 versus cex value of 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niii. Changing background color\nChanged the background color from grey to blue:\nChanging the background color of the histogram by replacing col=“gray80” with col=“lightblue”\n\n\n\niv. What does the first number in axis() stand for?\nThe first number in axis stands for which axis we are indicating the program to draw on. 1 indicates the top x-axis, 2 is the left y-axis, 3 is the bottom x-axis, and 4 is the right y-axis.\n\n\nv. Can you generate these charts individually?\nYes these charts can all be generated individually. In order to do this we need to remove the line of code par(mfrow=c(3, 2)) and run each plot by itself.\nExample of individual pie chart versus all charts together:\n\n\n\n\n\nc. Plotting functions (note: exercise using the happy planet data set\nhttp://happyplanetindex.org)\ni. par()\n\nPar is used at beginning of each separate graph inorder to reset the plot settings and produce these results individually \n\n\npar(mfrow=c(1, 1), mar=c(5, 5, 3, 3))  \n\nii. lines()\nUsing lines() to add a line into the HPI vs Life Expectancy graph \nlines(density(cleaned_data$HPI), col=“gray50”, lwd=2)\n\niii. points()\nUsing points to add different plots or points to both of the scatterplots\npoints(cleaned_data$HPI, cleaned_data$Life_Expectancy_years, pch=16, col=colors, cex=1.2)  # Points plot\npoints(cleaned_data$HPI, cleaned_data$Carbon_Footprint_tCO2e, pch=21, bg=colors_fp, \n       col=“gray30”, cex=1.5)  # Points plot with blue background\n\niv. axis()\nThis is used to add a custom or different axis to any of the plots \naxis(1, at=c(0, 5, 10), labels=c(“0”, “5”, “10”))\nv. box()\nUsing box to add a box around the plots\nbox(bty=“u”) \n\n\nvi. text()\nText is used to add text annotations to a plot \ntext(x=cleaned_data$HPI[1], y=cleaned_data$Life_Expectancy_years[1], \n     labels=cleaned_data$Country[1], pos=4, col=“gray50”, cex=0.8)  \n\n\nvii. mtext()\nThis is used to add margins to different plots \nmtext(“First country label”, side=3, line=1, cex=1, col=“black”)  # Title\nviii. hist()\nThe hist function is used to create a histogram. Here is the code used to  create our HPI histogram \nhist(cleaned_data$HPI, breaks=10, col=“gray80”, main=“Histogram of HPI”, xlab=“HPI”, \n     ylab=“Frequency”, ylim=c(0, max(table(cut(cleaned_data$HPI, breaks=10)))))\nix. boxplot()\nThis is used to create a boxplot. Here is the code used to create a boxplot for life expectancy \nboxplot(cleaned_data$Life_Expectancy_years ~ cleaned_data$Continent, \n        main=“Life Expectancy by Region”, xlab=“Region”, ylab=“Life Expectancy”, \n        col=“gray90”, border=“gray50”)  # Boxplot\n\n\nx. legend()\nThis is used to add a legend to the plot \nlegend(“topright”, legend=c(“Data Points”), pch=16, col=“gray30”) \n\nxi. persp()\nThe function persp is used to  create a 3D perspective plot\npersp(x, y, z, theta = 30, phi = 30, expand = 0.5, \n      col = “lightblue”, border = “gray50”, ltheta = 50, \n      shade = 0.5, xlab = “X-axis”, ylab = “Y-axis”, zlab = “Z-axis”)\nxii. names()\nThis function is used to set names for different columns \nnames(cleaned_data) &lt;- gsub(” “,”_“, names(cleaned_data)) \n\n\nxiii. pie()\nThe function pie is used to create a pie chart. Here, a pie chart is being used to observe the top five countries by ecological footprint \n\n\n\nd. Post your works on your blog/website\nBelow are the plots produced using the all countries sheet from the happy planet dataset."
