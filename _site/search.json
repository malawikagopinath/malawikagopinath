    "text": "1. Running Paul Murrell’s RGraphics basic R programs\n\ni. Can you change `pch`?\nYes, the pch value can be changed. Here are examples of different symbols used for the values on the scatter plot graph. For example, when the pch value on the graph was 16 the symbol was a filled in circle versus a triangle when it was 17. \n\n\nii. Try different cex values?\nThe cex values represents the sizes of the different plotting symbols and making them bigger or smaller. The larger the cex value the larger the plot. Here is an example between using cex value of 2 versus cex value of 8\n\n\niii. Changing background color\nChanged the background color from grey to blue:\nChanging the background color of the histogram by replacing col=“gray80” with col=“lightblue”iv. What does the first number in axis() stand for?\nThe first number in axis stands for which axis we are indicating the program to draw on. 1 indicates the top x-axis, 2 is the left y-axis, 3 is the bottom x-axis, and 4 is the right y-axis.\n\n\nv. Can you generate these charts individually?\nYes these charts can all be generated individually. In order to do this we need to remove the line of code par(mfrow=c(3, 2)) and run each plot by itself.\nExample of individual pie chart versus all charts together:\n\n\n\n\n\nc. Plotting functions (note: exercise using the happy planet data set\nhttp://happyplanetindex.org)\ni. par()\n\nPar is used at beginning of each separate graph inorder to reset the plot settings and produce these results individually\n\n\npar(mfrow=c(1, 1), mar=c(5, 5, 3, 3))\n\nii. lines()\nUsing lines() to add a line into the HPI vs Life Expectancy graph \nlines(density(cleaned_data$HPI), col=“gray50”, lwd=2)\n\niii. points()\nUsing points to add different plots or points to both of the scatterplots\npoints(cleaned_data$HPI, cleaned_data$Life_Expectancy_years, pch=16, col=colors, cex=1.2)  # Points plot\npoints(cleaned_data$HPI, cleaned_data$Carbon_Footprint_tCO2e, pch=21, bg=colors_fp, \n       col=“gray30”, cex=1.5)  # Points plot with blue background\n\niv. axis()\nThis is used to add a custom or different axis to any of the plots \naxis(1, at=c(0, 5, 10), labels=c(“0”, “5”, “10”))\nv. box()\nUsing box to add a box around the plots\nbox(bty=“u”) \n\n\nvi. text()\nText is used to add text annotations to a plot \ntext(x=cleaned_data$HPI[1], y=cleaned_data$Life_Expectancy_years[1], \n     labels=cleaned_data$Country[1], pos=4, col=“gray50”, cex=0.8)  \nvii. mtext()\nThis is used to add margins to different plots \nmtext(“First country label”, side=3, line=1, cex=1, col=“black”)  # Title\nviii. hist()\nThe hist function is used to create a histogram.

    "text": "2. Rerun anscombe01.R (in Teams folder)\na. Compare the regression models\nBased on the regression model analysis, the four models in Anscombe have similar characteristics with almost similar intercepts and slopes, as well as consistent residual errors. The F-test values also indicate a strong positive significance. All the models also have a p test value that is below 0.01, further indicating the significance of the models and thus indicating a close fit to the data.\nHowever, despite how similar these datasets are we notice very different graphical representations for each of them. This further highlights the importance of different datasets and understanding how to best visually represent each of them and emphasizes the need for careful observation and analysis. \nb. Compare different ways to create the plots (e.g. changing colors, line types, plot characters)\nHere we can see three different ways to create the plots. The first being the original, the second is with changing the colors, and this is changing the plotting character to an ‘x’. The symbol ‘x’ when used on these plots do not stand out as much as the original filled circle, the red also makes it dull compared to the orange filled circles used in the original plots. The graph line being blue like the original also stands out more than changing it to red. \n\n3. Can you finetune the charts without using other packages (consult RGraphics by Murrell)?\nYes these charts can be fine tuned to use a serif font, try non-default colors, and use own plotting characters without installing other packages. \n\na. Use a serif font\nSerif font or any other fonts can be inserted like so \npar(family = “serif”)\n\nb. Try non-default colors\nNon-default colors can be implemented using the ‘col=’ can be used. Hex codes for colors can be inserted.\nplot(pressure, pch=16, col=“#FF5733”, bg=“#D1E231”)  # custom point color and background color\ntext(150, 600, “Pressure (mm Hg)\\nversus\\nTemperature (Celsius)”,\ncol=“forestgreen”, cex=1.2)  # Custom color for the text\nc. Use own plotting character\nPch can be used to customize plotting characters. The pch values range from 0 to 25. For example pch =19 would be filled circles as the plotting character and pch = 24 would be upward filled triangles.\nplot(pressure, pch=24, col=“red”, bg=“yellow”, cex=1.5) # Use upward-pointing triangle with custom fill color text(150, 600, “Pressure (mm Hg)\\nversus\\nTemperature (Celsius)”, col=“green”, cex=1.2, family=“serif”)\n\n4. How about with ggplot2? (use tidyverse package)\nYes, the charts can be finetuned. Overall the usage of ggplot simplifies the graphics. It allows for a wider range of complex but visually informative graphs to be created. Here is the histogram and boxplot from murrel using ggplot. We can see a clear distinction between the data making it easier to understand."
